                <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
                <p>As a scientist, Einstein’s watershed year was 1905, when he was working as a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office, having failed to attain an academic position after earning his doctorate. That year he published his four most important papers. One of them 
				   described the relationship between matter and energy, neatly summarized E = mc2.

                <h2>Isaac Newton</h2>
                <p>
                  Halley persuaded Newton to publish his calculations, and the results were the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, or just the Principia, in 1687. Not only did it describe for the first time how the planets moved through space and how projectiles on Earth traveled through the air; 
		          the Principia showed that the same fundamental force, gravity, governs both. Newton united the heavens and the Earth with his laws. Thanks to him, scientists believed they had a chance of unlocking the universe’s secrets.       </p>

                <h2>Aryabhata</h2>
                <p>Aryabhata gave the world the digit "0" (zero) for which he became immortal. His book, the Aryabhatiya, presented astronomical and mathematical theories in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the sun (in other words, 
				it was heliocentric).
